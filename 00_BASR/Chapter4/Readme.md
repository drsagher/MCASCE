# Chapter 4 Perception and Computer Vision

Perception is the cornerstone of autonomous decision-making, enabling machines to interpret their surroundings using sensors like cameras, LIDAR, and radar. At the heart of perception lies **computer vision**, a field that empowers systems to extract meaningful information from visual data through techniques such as **image processing, feature detection, and 3D reconstruction**. Fundamental tasks include **object detection and recognition**, often implemented using Python libraries like **OpenCV** and deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Camera calibration ensures accurate spatial measurements, while **3D reconstruction** techniques convert 2D images into depth-aware models. For dynamic environments, **perception algorithms like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** fuse sensor data to build real-time maps and track positions. Together, these components form the backbone of autonomous navigation, robotics, and AI-driven systems, bridging raw sensor inputs to actionable intelligence.  

## Computer Vision

**Computer Vision** is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual data from the world, much like human vision. By leveraging techniques from **image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning**, computer vision systems can perform tasks such as **object detection, facial recognition, motion tracking, and scene reconstruction**. Key processes include **image filtering, edge detection, feature extraction (e.g., SIFT, ORB), and deep learning-based approaches (e.g., CNNs, YOLO, Transformers)** to analyze and classify visual inputs. Applications span across industries, from **autonomous vehicles (lane detection, pedestrian recognition) and robotics (object manipulation) to healthcare (medical imaging) and augmented reality (3D pose estimation)**. With advancements in **real-time processing, edge AI, and multimodal sensor fusion**, computer vision continues to push the boundaries of how machines perceive and interact with their environment.  


### **Basics of Computer Vision**  

Computer vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and analyze visual data from images or videos. At its core, CV relies on **digital image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning** to extract meaningful information from pixels. The foundational steps include:

   - **AR/VR** (object tracking, gesture recognition).  



## Object detection and recognition using Python libraries (e.g., OpenCV)


Object detection and recognition are fundamental tasks in computer vision that involve identifying and locating objects within images or video streams. These technologies power applications like autonomous vehicles, security systems, medical imaging, and augmented reality.

Object detection combines two tasks:
- **Object Localization**: Finding the position of objects in an image (bounding boxes)
- **Object Classification**: Identifying what type of object is present

**Prerequisites**

Before diving into object detection, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of computer vision concepts
- Familiarity with machine learning fundamentals
- Python environment set up with required libraries

**Understanding Object Detection**

***Key Concepts***

**Bounding Box**: A rectangle that encloses an object, defined by coordinates that specify its position and size.

**Confidence Score**: A probability value indicating how certain the model is about its detection - higher scores mean more reliable detections.

**Class Label**: The category or type of object detected (e.g., person, car, dog, cat).

**Intersection over Union (IoU)**: A metric measuring the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes, used to evaluate detection accuracy.

**Popular Python Libraries**

***OpenCV***
OpenCV is a comprehensive computer vision library that includes built-in object detection algorithms. It's particularly good for traditional computer vision approaches and real-time applications due to its efficiency.

***TensorFlow/Keras***
TensorFlow provides deep learning-based object detection models with pre-trained models available. It offers high accuracy but requires more computational resources.

***PyTorch***

**OpenCV for Object Detection**

***Haar Cascades***
Haar cascades are traditional object detection methods based on Haar-like features. They work by training on positive and negative images to learn the features of specific objects like faces. The method is fast and works well for frontal face detection but has limitations with different orientations and complex scenes.

***HOG + SVM for Pedestrian Detection***
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM) is another traditional approach. HOG captures the distribution of gradient orientations in an image, which is particularly effective for detecting human figures and pedestrians.

***YOLO (You Only Look Once)***

YOLO is a real-time object detection system that processes the entire image in one go, unlike traditional methods that examine parts of the image separately. This approach makes YOLO much faster while maintaining good accuracy.

***YOLO Architecture***
YOLO divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell simultaneously. Each grid cell predicts multiple bounding boxes and confidence scores for those boxes.

***YOLO Variants***
- **YOLOv3**: Improved accuracy with better feature extraction
- **YOLOv4**: Enhanced performance with various optimization techniques

***Pre-trained Models***
The API offers several pre-trained models trained on the COCO dataset, including:
- SSD MobileNet (fast but less accurate)
- Faster R-CNN (more accurate but slower)
- EfficientDet (balanced approach)

**Performance Evaluation**

***Metrics for Object Detection***

**Intersection over Union (IoU)**: Measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. Higher IoU values indicate better localization accuracy.

**Precision and Recall**: 
- Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions (how many detections were correct)
- Recall measures the completeness of detections (how many actual objects were detected)

**Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: A comprehensive metric that combines precision and recall across different IoU thresholds and object classes.

**Advanced Topics**

## Camera calibration and 3D reconstruction

Camera calibration is a fundamental process in computer vision that involves determining the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera to accurately map 3D world points to 2D image points. Intrinsic parameters include the focal length, optical center, and lens distortion coefficients, while extrinsic parameters describe the camera's position and orientation in 3D space relative to the world coordinate system. This calibration process is essential for removing distortions, correcting perspective errors, and enabling accurate measurements from images. 3D reconstruction builds upon calibrated cameras to recreate three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional images, using techniques such as stereo vision, structure from motion (SfM), and multi-view stereo. By analyzing multiple images of an object or scene from different viewpoints, algorithms can triangulate point correspondences, estimate depth information, and generate dense 3D point clouds or meshes. These techniques are widely applied in fields like robotics for navigation and object manipulation, augmented reality for realistic scene integration, medical imaging for anatomical modeling, architectural modeling for building documentation, and autonomous vehicles for environment perception. The accuracy of 3D reconstruction heavily depends on proper camera calibration, robust feature matching, and sophisticated algorithms that can handle challenges such as occlusions, textureless surfaces, varying lighting conditions, and noise in the input images.

**1. Camera Calibration**
Camera calibration is the process of determining the **intrinsic** (lens/sensor properties) and **extrinsic** (position/orientation) parameters of a camera to correct distortions and enable accurate measurements from images.

**Why Calibrate?**
- Corrects lens distortion (barrel, pincushion effects).
- Enables metric measurements (e.g., real-world distances from pixels).
- Critical for **stereo vision** and **3D reconstruction**.

**Key Parameters**

| **Parameter Type** | **Description**                              | **Example**                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Intrinsic**      | Camera-specific properties (focal length, optical center, skew) | `fx, fy` (focal lengths), `(cx, cy)` (principal point) |
| **Extrinsic**      | Camera position/orientation in 3D space      | Rotation matrix (`R`), translation vector (`t`) |
| **Distortion**     | Radial/tangential lens distortion coefficients | `k1, k2` (radial), `p1, p2` (tangential) |


**Calibration Process**

1. **Capture Images** of a calibration pattern (e.g., checkerboard) from multiple angles.  
2. **Detect Points** (e.g., chessboard corners) using OpenCV:  
   ```python
   import cv2
   ret, corners = cv2.findChessboardCorners(gray_image, (9,6), None)
   ```
3. **Compute Parameters** with `cv2.calibrateCamera()`:  
   ```python
   ret, K, dist, rvecs, tvecs = cv2.calibrateCamera(obj_points, img_points, image_size, None, None)
   ```
   - `K`: Intrinsic matrix.  
   - `dist`: Distortion coefficients.  

4. **Undistort Images**:  
   ```python
   undistorted = cv2.undistort(image, K, dist)
   ```


**2. 3D Reconstruction**
3D reconstruction creates a **3D model** of a scene from 2D images. Techniques include:

**A. Stereo Vision**
- Uses **two calibrated cameras** (stereo pair) to compute depth via triangulation.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. **Rectify Images**: Align epipolar lines (`cv2.stereoRectify`).  
  2. **Compute Disparity Map**:  
     ```python
     stereo = cv2.StereoSGBM_create(minDisparity=0, numDisparities=16)
     disparity = stereo.compute(left_img, right_img)
     ```
  3. **Depth Calculation**:  
     ```
     depth = (baseline * focal_length) / disparity
     ```

**B. Structure from Motion (SfM)**
- Reconstructs 3D structure from **multiple 2D images** of a scene.  
- **Pipeline**:  
  1. **Feature Matching**: Detect/keypoints (SIFT, ORB) across images.  
  2. **Camera Pose Estimation**: Solve using **PnP (Perspective-n-Point)**.  
  3. **Bundle Adjustment**: Optimize 3D points and camera poses (e.g., COLMAP).  

**C. Depth Sensors (LiDAR, RGB-D)**
- Directly capture depth data (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect).  
- **OpenCV Integration**:  
  ```python
  depth_map = cv2.imread("depth.png", cv2.IMREAD_ANYDEPTH)
  ```

**5. Example: 3D Reconstruction from Stereo Images**
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load stereo images
left = cv2.imread("left.jpg", 0)
right = cv2.imread("right.jpg", 0)

# Stereo matching
stereo = cv2.StereoSGBM_create(minDisparity=0, numDisparities=64)
disparity = stereo.compute(left, right)

# Visualize
cv2.imshow("Disparity", disparity / 64.0)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

**Output**: A disparity map where brighter pixels indicate closer objects.
