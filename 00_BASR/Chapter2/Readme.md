# Chapter 2 Fundamentals of Systems Engineering

Systems engineering is a multidisciplinary approach critical to the development of complex autonomous systems, providing structured principles to design, integrate, and manage sophisticated technologies. For autonomous systems, such as robots, self-driving vehicles, or smart infrastructure, systems engineering principles ensure reliability, efficiency, and performance by addressing requirements, constraints, and stakeholder needs. The process involves modeling and analyzing complex systems to understand their behavior, predict outcomes, and optimize functionality using tools like simulations, state diagrams, and mathematical models. System architecture and design methodologies, such as modular design and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), guide the creation of robust frameworks, enabling seamless interaction between components. A key focus is the integration of hardware (e.g., sensors, actuators) and software (e.g., control algorithms, AI) to achieve cohesive operation, ensuring that autonomous systems function effectively in dynamic environments while meeting safety, scalability, and adaptability requirements.
