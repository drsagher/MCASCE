# Chapter 1 Introduction to Autonomous Systems and Robotics

Autonomous systems and robotics represent a transformative field in modern technology, enabling machines to perform tasks with minimal human intervention. Autonomous systems are defined as intelligent entities capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions independently, often guided by advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence. Robotics, a key subset of this domain, encompasses the design, construction, and operation of robots, which are programmable machines that interact with the physical world. The history of robotics traces back to early mechanical automata, evolving into sophisticated systems like industrial robots, service robots, and collaborative robots (cobots). These systems find applications across diverse industries, including transportation (e.g., self-driving cars), healthcare (e.g., surgical robots), and manufacturing (e.g., automated assembly lines), driving efficiency, precision, and innovation. At their core, autonomous systems rely on critical components: sensors to gather environmental data, actuators to perform physical actions, controllers to process information, and software to enable decision-making and adaptability. This integration of hardware and software underpins the revolutionary impact of autonomous systems in shaping the future of technology and society.
