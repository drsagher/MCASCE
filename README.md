### Eligibility Criteria for MCASCE
To ensure candidates are prepared for the technical demands of the certification, the following eligibility requirements are recommended:

1. **Educational Background**:
   - Bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics, Information Technology, or a related field.  
   - Alternatively, a diploma or associate degree with relevant work experience (e.g., 2+ years in software development, cloud computing, or robotics).

2. 

3. **Work Experience (Optional)**:
   - 1–2 years of experience in software development, cloud infrastructure, or robotics is preferred but not mandatory for motivated learners.
   - Relevant projects (e.g., building AI agents, deploying cloud applications, or programming robots) can substitute for professional experience.

4. **Certifications (Optional)**:
   - Completion of foundational certifications like AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer, or a basic robotics/AI course (e.g., Coursera’s AI for Everyone or ROS tutorials).
   - Mansha’s own foundational course, such as **Mansha Certified Cloud Robotics Fundamentals (MCCRF)**, could be a prerequisite.

5. **Other Requirements**:
   - Access to a computer with internet connectivity for cloud-based labs and simulations.
   - Familiarity with tools like ROS (Robot Operating System), Docker, or Kubernetes is a plus but not required.

*Note*: If you want to make MCASCE accessible to beginners, you could offer a preparatory course to cover prerequisites, or adjust eligibility to only require basic programming and enthusiasm for learning.

#### Assessment
- **Quizzes**: Weekly quizzes on concepts (20% of grade).
- **Labs**: Hands-on assignments (30% of grade).
- **Capstone Project**: Final project evaluation (40% of grade).
- **Participation**: Engagement in discussions or forums (10% of grade).

#### Tools and Platforms
- **Software**: ROS, Gazebo, Python, TensorFlow, Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud (with student credits if available).
- **Hardware (Optional)**: Access to a small robot kit (e.g., Raspberry Pi with sensors) or virtual simulations.
