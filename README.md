### Section 1: Reality (Perception and Awareness)
This section evaluates your ability to accurately perceive and interpret the world, distinguishing fact from bias or illusion.

1. **Multiple-Choice**: When faced with conflicting information (e.g., two people describing the same event differently), what is your first step to determine what is true?
   - a) Trust your instincts immediately.
   - b) Seek additional evidence or sources.
   - c) Accept the most convincing narrative.
   - d) Ignore the conflict and move on.
   - **Scoring**: b (+2), a/c (+1), d (0). Seeking evidence indicates strong grounding in reality.

2. **Open-Ended**: Describe a situation where you realized your initial perception of an event or person was incorrect. How did you adjust your understanding, and what did you learn?

3. **Scenario-Based**: You witness an accident, but two bystanders provide contradictory accounts of what happened. How would you determine which account is closer to the truth? Provide a step-by-step explanation of your approach.

---

### Section 2: Knowledge (Retention and Application)
This section assesses your ability to recall and apply factual information effectively.

4. **Multiple-Choice**: When learning new information, how do you ensure you retain it for future use?
   - a) Memorize it through repetition.
   - b) Connect it to something you already know.
   - c) Write it down and review it later.
   - d) Rely on looking it up when needed.
   - **Scoring**: b/c (+2), a (+1), d (0). Connecting or reviewing information shows stronger retention strategies.

5. **Open-Ended**: Share an example of a time you used specific knowledge (e.g., a fact, skill, or procedure) to solve a practical problem. What was the knowledge, and how did you apply it?

6. **Scenario-Based**: You’re tasked with assembling a piece of equipment, but the instructions are incomplete. You’ve been given a fact sheet with key technical details about the equipment. How would you use this information to complete the task successfully?

### Section 3: Wisdom (Judgment and Decision-Making)
This section evaluates your ability to make sound, ethical, and forward-thinking decisions in complex situations.

7. **Multiple-Choice**: When making a difficult decision, what factor do you prioritize most?
   - a) Short-term benefits for yourself.
   - b) Long-term consequences for all involved.
   - c) The opinions of others.
   - d) Avoiding conflict at all costs.
   - **Scoring**: b (+2), a/c (+1), d (0). Prioritizing long-term consequences reflects wisdom.

8. **Open-Ended**: Describe a time when you had to make a tough decision that involved balancing competing priorities (e.g., personal gain vs. group benefit). What did you decide, and why?

9. **Scenario-Based**: You’re leading a team with limited resources to complete a project. One team member suggests cutting corners to finish faster, while another insists on quality, which will take longer. How would you decide what to do, and what factors would you consider?

---

### Section 4: Understanding (Insight and Contextual Application)
This section assesses your ability to grasp deeper meanings, see relationships between concepts, and apply them in context.

10. **Multiple-Choice**: When faced with a complex problem, how do you approach understanding it?
    - a) Break it down into smaller parts.
    - b) Look for patterns or connections to other problems.
    - c) Ask someone else for their perspective.
    - d) Try random solutions until something works.
    - **Scoring**: a/b (+2), c (+1), d (0). Analytical and pattern-based approaches indicate deeper understanding.

11. **Open-Ended**: Describe a time when you gained a deeper understanding of a situation or concept by seeing it from a new perspective. What changed in your approach or thinking?

12. **Scenario-Based**: You’re given a task to improve a community space, but the community members have conflicting needs (e.g., some want a playground, others want a quiet garden). How would you analyze the situation to propose a solution that balances these needs? Explain your reasoning.

  - 20-29: Strong in most areas, with room for growth in specific aspects.
  - 10-19: Moderate abilities, needing development in multiple areas.
  - 0-9: Significant gaps in perception, knowledge, judgment, or insight.

### Administration Notes
- **Format**: Administer the questionnaire in written form (paper or digital) or as an interview for more in-depth responses.
- **Time**: Allow 15-20 minutes for completion, with additional time for interviews if needed.
- **Analysis**: Use a rubric for open-ended and scenario-based questions to ensure consistency. Look for evidence of self-awareness, logical reasoning, and practical application.
- **Context**: Tailor scenarios to the participant’s background (e.g., workplace, school, or community settings) for relevance.
- **Combination with Physical Tests**: Use this questionnaire alongside the physical tests described earlier to get a holistic view of the participant’s abilities.

### Sample Use Case
- **Reality**: A participant who scores high on seeking evidence and describes a clear process for verifying information likely has a strong grasp of reality.
- **Knowledge**: A participant who recalls specific details and applies them effectively in a scenario demonstrates robust knowledge retention and use.
- **Wisdom**: Responses that prioritize long-term outcomes and ethical considerations indicate wise judgment.
- **Understanding**: Answers that show pattern recognition and creative synthesis of ideas reflect deep understanding.

### **Why This Works**  
- **Fair for Non-CS Candidates**: BASR section tests conceptual grasp, not hands-on robotics.  
- **Relevance**: Aligns with MCASCE’s focus on **Agentic AI + Cloud**.  
- **Prep Material**: Link to free **BASR Primer Kit** (videos + quizzes) on [mvitech.org](https://mvitech.org).  

**Pro Tip**: Add 1-2 **sample BASR questions** to the registration page to set expectations (e.g., *"What is sensor fusion?"*).  

Let me know if you'd like to adjust weightings or add a coding task!
