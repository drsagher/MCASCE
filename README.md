## Admission Test Eligibility Criteria
- **Program Name:** Mansha Certified Autonomous Systems and Cloud Engineer (MCASCE)
- **Duration:** 24 months (including 1-month on-job training + 2-month final project)

**Eligibility:** Open to all, but priority given to candidates with:
- A Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (CS), IT, Mathematics, Statistics or Economic.
- **Others:** Strong foundational knowledge in programming/math (self-taught or certifications accepted).

### Admission Test Syllabus  

Here’s the updated **Admission Test Syllabus**, incorporating the **[Basics of Autonomous Systems & Robotics (BASR)](00_BASR/Readme.md)** course as a core component, while keeping it accessible to candidates from CS/IT/Math/Stat backgrounds:


### **Exam Structure**  
| **Part** | **Topics**               | **Format**              | **Weight** |  
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------|  
| A        | Technical Foundations     | 20 MCQs                 | 60%        |  
| B        | BASR Concepts             | 10 MCQs + 2 Short Answer| 40%        |  

**Total Duration**: 120 minutes  
**Passing Threshold**: 50% aggregate (30% minimum in each section)  


### **Why This Works**  
- **Fair for Non-CS Candidates**: BASR section tests conceptual grasp, not hands-on robotics.  
- **Relevance**: Aligns with MCASCE’s focus on **Agentic AI + Cloud**.  
- **Prep Material**: Link to free **BASR Primer Kit** (videos + quizzes) on [mvitech.org](https://mvitech.org).  

**Pro Tip**: Add 1-2 **sample BASR questions** to the registration page to set expectations (e.g., *"What is sensor fusion?"*).
